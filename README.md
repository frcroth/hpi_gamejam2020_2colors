# TFJ - HPI GameJam 2020 - Two Colors

The game works as follows:
  * Two players play **against** each other.
  * The concept is a simple Last-Man-Standing game, with some nice twists :)
  * One player is **red**, the other one **red**.
  * There is a playfield, that consists of square fields, each red or blue.
  * Every beat of the playing music, the field colors are changing to the opposite.
  * Once a player is on a field that not fits its color, the player dies.
  * There are several powerups a player can collect, to get closer to killing the other player.
